# Conversion
- The conversion team plays a vital role in the client onboarding process, particularly when it involves migrating data from an old system to a new one.
- Their responsibilities ensure that the client's data is accurately and efficiently transferred, maintaining data integrity and minimizing disruption.
  
### 1. Data Assessment and Planning
- **Initial Assessment**: Evaluate the client's existing data to understand its structure, quality, and any potential issues.
- **Conversion Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive strategy for data conversion, including timelines, tools, and methodologies.

### 2. Data Mapping and Transformation
- **Data Mapping**: Define how data from the old system will be transformed and loaded into the new system. This includes creating detailed data mapping documents.
- **Transformation Rules**: Establish rules for data transformation, ensuring data types, formats, and structures are compatible with the new system.

### 3. Data Extraction
- **Extraction Logic**: Develop and implement logic to extract data from the client's existing system. This may involve creating scripts or using data migration tools.
- **Validation**: Ensure that the extracted data is complete and accurate before moving forward.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Quality Assurance
- **Data Cleansing**: Identify and correct any issues in the data, such as duplicates, inaccuracies, or missing values.
- **Quality Checks**: Perform rigorous quality checks to ensure that the data meets predefined standards and is fit for use in the new system.

### 5. Data Loading and Verification
- **Loading**: Load the transformed data into the new system, following the mapping and transformation rules.
- **Verification**: Verify that the data has been loaded correctly and that all records are intact and accessible.

### 6. Testing and Validation
- **Unit Testing**: Conduct unit tests to validate individual components of the conversion process.
- **Full Conversion Testing**: Perform a full-scale test run (mock conversion) to ensure the entire process works as intended.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Involve end-users in testing the new system to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

### 7. Documentation and Training
- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation of the conversion process, including data mappings, transformation rules, and any issues encountered.
- **Training**: Provide training to the client's team on the new system, focusing on any changes resulting from the data conversion.

### 8. Go-Live Support
- **Support During Go-Live**: Offer support during the go-live phase to address any issues or questions that arise.
- **Post-Conversion Review**: Conduct a review after go-live to identify any remaining issues and ensure that the system is functioning smoothly.

### 9. Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather feedback from the client and use it to refine and improve the conversion process for future projects.
- **Updates and Enhancements**: Implement any necessary updates or enhancements to the conversion process based on feedback and lessons learned.

The conversion team ensures a smooth and successful data migration, laying a solid foundation for the clientâ€™s use of the new system and contributing to a positive onboarding experience.
